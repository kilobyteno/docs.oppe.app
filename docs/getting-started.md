# Getting started

Create your self a **free** account at [oppe.app](https://oppe.app) and follow the instructions to get started.

## Creating a project
Once you have created your account, you can create a project. A project is a collection of monitors. You can create as many projects as your subscription allows.

**Our suggestion:**
> Use the projects as a way to group your monitors. For example, you could create a project for your sandbox environment, a project for your staging environment and a project for your production environment. Or you could create a project for each of your websites, apps, SaaS, or whatever you want to monitor in a group.

To create a project, click on the `+` button in the sidebar on the dashboard. You will be asked to enter a name for your project and an optional description. Once you have entered a name, click on the `Create` button.

## Creating a channel
Channels are a way to get collect events. You can create as many channels as your subscription allows. You can create a channel for each of your projects, or you can create a channel for each of your environments. It's up to you how you want to use channels.

**Our suggestion:**
> Use the channels as a way to group your events. For example, you could create a channel for one of your microservices, for example one for User Management, one for Payments, one for your API, etc. Or you could create a channel for each of your websites.
